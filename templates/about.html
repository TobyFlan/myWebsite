                <p class="main-text">Most of this website is explaining things about myself, so I dont see much use for this
                    section. I just wanted to include a 'Me' section in the 'About' page because it makes sense to have it 
                    there. Despite this, I do not know what to write here, so instead, I'm not going to write anything at all.

                <p class="main-text">Completed my GCSEs at Simon Balle all-through school, attaining top grades,
                    including a 9 in physics, and 8s and 7s in other subjects. Pursued A-levels in physics, computer 
                    science, and maths, securing A star,A,A respectively, with an additional A in further maths at AS level.

                <p class="main-text">
                    Currently in my 3rd year at the University of Leeds, studying computer science in the School of
                    Computer Science. Earned a 1st grade in both the first and second years. Currently focusing on 
                    modules such as cryptography, machine learning, and computer graphics.

                    My goal is to achieve a bachelor's degree in computer science by June 2024.

                <h1 class="main-header">Work</h1>

                <p class="main-text">My professional journey has revolved around building a solid foundation in software 
                    development and IT. As a tutor for GCSE students, I honed my technical expertise while guiding and 
                    supporting them in computer science-related subjects. This role allowed me to refine my ability to 
                    explain complex concepts effectively. Additionally, I gained valuable experience during my time at CEX, 
                    where I demonstrated problem-solving skills and adaptability in a technology-driven retail environment. 
                    Now, with hands-on experience in various projects and a genuine passion for technology, I am eager to 
                    leverage my skills to contribute to impactful software development and IT initiatives, making a positive
                    impact in this dynamic industry.

                <h1 class="main-header">Hobbies</h1>

                <p class="main-text">My diverse range of hobbies has not only enriched my life but also sharpened valuable skills 
                    that complement my passion for software development and IT. Participating in a Manchester hackathon opened 
                    doors to new connections and exposed me to exciting projects from various companies. Embracing a healthy 
                    lifestyle, I actively engage in the yoga society, nurturing both my physical and mental well-being. As a 
                    captain of an esports team at my university, I honed my leadership and teamwork abilities while competing in 
                    tournaments. Additionally, I find solace in music, playing both guitar and piano, which has imrpoved my 
                    patience, discipline, and creativity. My personal software projects, crafted during my free time, demonstrate my 
                    continuous drive to innovate and improve my skills.
